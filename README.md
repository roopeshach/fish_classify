# Fish Classification

## Overview
This project classifies different species of fish based on various attributes using machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as length, weight, and width to differentiate fish species.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including encoding and scaling.
- Training multiple machine learning models for fish classification.
- Performance comparison of different classification algorithms.
- Visualization of dataset trends and model performance.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on fish species with features such as:

| Column Name  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Species     | Type of fish (e.g., Bream, Roach, Perch, etc.) |
| Weight      | Weight of the fish (grams) |
| Length      | Various length measurements (in cm) |
| Width       | Width of the fish (cm) |
| Height      | Height of the fish (cm) |

## Models Used
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Na√Øve Bayes (GaussianNB)
4. Deep Learning Model (Neural Network)
